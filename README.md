# README Files
Readme files are a great way to communicate to users of your program or module on it's workings.

## How README Files Work

README files by using a language called markdown to be able to display the information as if it were a webpage.  Github automatically can read README files and display it on your screen

Advantages of README files:

- Clean and efficent
- Can explain instructions
- Can provide color-coded syntax of programming langauges


## Coding Snippet Example

We can actually use readme files to type in piece of code that will be rendered as a code snippet.  This can allow us to color code our syntax, as well as prevent any spacing or tabbing issues.

This is a print statement in python

```python
print("Hello World")
print("Goodbye")
```
